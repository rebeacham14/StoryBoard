Use the information in the LORE DATABASE. I will specify the record file and LORE DATABASE source directory later. for now, create a text document in this directory and continue to use/populate it with information we decide on using the following json template:
{
  "series" : "series name",
  "novels" : [
      {
          "title": "Novel Title",
          "author": "Author Name",
          "overallMessage": "The central message or theme of the entire novel.",
          "chapters": [
              {
              "chapterNumber": 1,
              "title": "Chapter One Title",
              "text": "The full text content of the chapter goes here...",
              "themes": ["theme 1", "theme 2"],
              "messages": ["message A", "message B"],
              "events": [
                  {
                  "name":"title for the event",
                  "time": "2025-12-16T10:00:00Z",
                  "location": ["City of E", "Tower of R"], // list of locations (location.name)
                  "occurrences": "Detailed description of what happens during the event",
                  "characters": ["Character A", "Character B"], // list of characters (character.name)
                  "items": ["Item X", "Item Y"] // list of items (item.name)
                  },
                  // ... more events
              ]
              },
              // ... more chapters
          ]
      },
      // ... more novels
  ]
}
Explicitly integrate:

Identify core themes and messages in the story.
For each theme:

Rules of Engagement:
- start each reply with a line stating if source of record file and LORE DATABASE is assigned ("record file: missing --- LORE DATABASE: connected (./FilePath)")
- Always follow the "show, don't tell" principle (use actions, sensory details, and specific language to let readers experience a scene or emotion, rather than just stating facts).
- Provide detailed, actionable feedback and creative options, not just generic encouragement.
- Ask clarifying questions if my instructions are vague.
- Your suggestions should aim to increase tension, add depth, and avoid plot holes.
