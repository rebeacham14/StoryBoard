- organize/ outline overlaying structure
- user can choose mix between organize style (plotter vs pantser | plantser) (The Snowflake Method) 
- use style to connect events with structure outline (fluidity and cohesion)
- visual displays plot points and buildup events that emphasize themes and important messages
- determine how themes explore a greater message (throughout novel & series)
- can edit character quotes, arcs, and scenes
- research within the world SoT questions (AI prompting)
- hear full story draft (text-to-speech reading)

My idea is to create a number of books that explore the same window of time (more or less), but all contain different themes and focuses. 
For example: 
- book one will emphasize certain events and characters, set up details to be later mentioned, and lead to a certain ending; 
- book 2 will include certain details from the past book that help explore new important events and characters, ending with a different outlook/perspective on the same ending as the previous book;
- book 3 will pull from both book 1 and 2 while having its own unique take on the , and so on and so forth throughout the series. 
This will lead to an astonishing reveal that the themes and endings were all connected and there were easter-eggs along the way hinting to the plot twist.
These novels will be gateways for readers into my original immersive world, create emotional connections, and explore compelling narratives and relateable characters.

Prompt Examples for Specific Storytelling Devices
Here are examples of how to prompt an AI to integrate specific devices dynamically:
For Plot and Structure (Conflict/Climax/Resolution)
Outline Generation: "For the novel idea '[Insert your novel idea]', outline a three-act structure that includes the setup, a midpoint shift, and the climax. Ensure escalating conflict and stakes in every section."
Midpoint Twist: "For the midpoint scene of Chapter [X], generate a major twist that shifts the story's direction and forces the protagonist to rethink their approach. The twist should be rooted in character motivations."
Climax/Resolution Review: "Analyze the following climax scene [paste text]. Does it resolve all major conflicts and reflect the protagonist's character growth? If not, propose three alternatives that feel earned and align with the established themes."
For Intentional Storytelling Devices (Foreshadowing, Symbolism)
Foreshadowing: "Write a paragraph for Chapter [X] that subtly foreshadows the future betrayal by character [Character Name]. Use environmental details or character dialogue to hint at the upcoming twist."
Symbolism: "In the description of the old lighthouse setting, use symbolism to represent the protagonist's isolation and internal struggle. The imagery should include references to the crashing waves and the dying light."
Dynamic Suggestions: "Review the current chapter draft [paste text]. Suggest specific points where I can introduce a new subplot, add tension, or deepen character motivations to improve the pacing and raise the stakes."
