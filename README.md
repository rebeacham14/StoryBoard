Got scammed from a fake NVIDIA email. Crazy story. Ended up pushing me to start my portfolio. Got so excited though, that i dreamed about what it would be like being that developed. Thats where I want to be, and I'll never let go of that. I have been carless (public transportation), laptop had screen issues (traveled with a monitor), even against the odds I had to fight. 

This pushed me into striving for the best of my self. I look around and see nothing... nothing but potential and opportunity. I know I'm that guy. Now it's time to do that thing.
